# Intro
This documents my solutions to the [Cryptopals](http://cryptopals.com/) challenges.

I started with Ruby and now that I'm learning Go, I'm attempting the challenges in Go as well and I'll keep updating this repo with my solutions.

# Run challenge script
Run the file name for each challenge.

## Ruby
Run the solution script in this format: `ruby ruby/set-number/challenge-file-path.rb`.

For example:

```bash
ruby set1/1_hex_to_base_64.rb
```
